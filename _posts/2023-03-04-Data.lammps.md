# Data.Lammps

Let's create cyclohexylamine in a periodic box of dimensions 60\*60\*60 cubic angstrom.

## Step 01: Ligpargen

- Goto the Ligand parameter generator ([Ligpargen](http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/moleculeDraw.html)) online server and draw molecule (cyclohexylamine)

![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_dc2fdde918bad6c7.png)

- Now press convert to SMILES

![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_d3eada503e6d145f.png)

- Leave everything as default and then press submit molecule

![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_6cbad2327b5b6482.png)

- Now wait for few minutes then download all files as zip ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_976916c113ea0698.png)

- Now extract files in separate folder ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_f0f3b264b93a6249.png)

- Now we will convert .pqr format to zmat format using openbabel, go to [openbabel](https://www.cheminfo.org/Chemistry/Cheminformatics/FormatConverter/index.html) online website
- Upload the UNKD62CC4.pqr to the website ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_5b2d565f269780b1.png)
- In option section select input file as pqr format and output file as gzmat ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_695e2f588c103007.png)
- Make sure you get no error during conversion as shown

![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_96e41d1b4fa44f02.png)

- Now copy the output file contents to a file named moleculename.zmat from N to d20

![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_63759c29dca3c230.png)

## Step 02: require file generation for fftool

- This instructions are for both Linux and windows
- Now go to [fftool](https://github.com/paduagroup/fftool) git repository and download the whole repository as zip

![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_d6e3b200430ed5fe.png)

- Extract the content to separate folder ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_cae526b8f8c0c40a.png)

- Here rename fftool to fftool.py do the same with lattice.py and xyztool.py ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_e7ed47b9494e0315.png)

- Now install python3 (find out how to do this on the internet)
- Also download [Packmol](https://github.com/m3g/packmol) from github repository only for Linux ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_1957dfea9f21fbf4.png)

- Extract zip in separate folder and install Packmol as follows
  - tar -xvzf packmol-20.13.0.tar.gz
- This will create a directory called packmol inside which you can find the source code. You can build the executable by:
  - cd packmol
  - make
- That's it, if no error was reported the packmol executable was built. Note that 20.13.0 is the version number, which may differ relative to this example.
- If you have problems, let the configure script find a suitable compiler for you:
  - chmod +x ./configure (this makes the script executable)
  - ./configure (this executes the script)
- If the script was not able to find a suitable compiler, then you can manually set the compiler by:
  - ./configure /path/to/your/compiler/yourcompiler
- Then, run the "make" command again:
  - make
- If no error was detected, an executable called packmol is now ready.
- If you are using Windows machine directly download the packmol binary or packmol.exe from the [link](https://github.com/m3g/packmol/tree/gh-pages/docs/Windows_Binaries/20.3.3-Windows10-64bits) no need to install just place packmol.exe in fftool forder where we are going to use this
- Now at this point we have installed packmol in ubuntu just locate the packmol binaries and copy this to the fftool folder ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_ea1f2a3c449f7b3a.png)
- You can read how to use fftool by opening README.md, and also from example folder lots of molecules are given to generate lammps data file
- Here we are trying to parameterise a new molecule from scratch for that keep following this instructions
- Lets Recap what we have so far: ![Shape1](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_bf6d6be7755fe8a1.gif)
- Now we have to prepare input files for fftool
  - First input is a molecule.gmat file (Contains bond length and angle of the molecule)
  - Second is forcefield.ff file (contains all the parameters of the bonds, angles,dihedral etc)
- Now open the .key file in any text editor ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_fcb77dd8288c03b6.png)

- Also open molecule.gmat and replace each atomic with the name in .key file
- For example replace N as N01, C as C01 C as C02 and so on
- Make a file named cha.ff (.ff extension is mandatory)
- Now download all the files from this [github repository](https://github.com/alokranjancheme/paramcyclohexylamine) and then observe carefully what are the changes has been done using .key format
- Also pay proper attention to the unit used in the .ff file

##

## Step 03: using fftool to generate data file for lammps

- First put all the file necessary for fftool in separate folder ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_8977756ecf86f99c.png)
- Open terminal in the same directory type the following command
  - python3 fftool.py 100 CHA.zmat -b 60
  - Output: density 0.769 mol/L volume 216000.0 A^3

molecule\_file species nmol force\_field nbond source charge

CHA.zmat CHA 100 CHA.ff 20 file +0.0000

packmol file

pack.inp

- Note: it is also important to rename the atoms name in .gmat file as per key values if you do not rename these atoms you may encounter error as "Atom ID mismatch"
- Now type:

  - ./packmol \<pack.inp
  - Output: ##########################################################

Success!

Final objective function value: .15081E-02

Maximum violation of target distance: 0.000000

Maximum violation of the constraints: .00000E+00

Running time: 6.56569973E-02 seconds.

- Finally to convert simbox to lammps data file type:
  - python3 fftool.py 100 CHA.zmat -b 60 -l

Output: density 0.769 mol/L volume 216000.0 A^3

molecule\_file species nmol force\_field nbond source charge

CHA.zmat CHA 100 CHA.ff 20 file +0.0000

lammps files units real

in.lmp

data.lmp

- If everything run without any error then your folder will look like this ![](RackMultipart20230304-1-hsm8yl_html_6f0eb42835107658.png)

Congratulations now you have successfully created lammps data file in the next section we will learn how to write input script for lammps
